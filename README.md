Hi there!


I'm learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by mid of 2021.  
This repository is for SQL excercises done by me while learning SQL on various platforms and courses.  

List of course:
1. **Learn SQL** -- on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)   
2. **SQL exercises** -- on [sql-ex.ru](https://www.sql-ex.ru/?Lang=1)    
3. **SQL course** -- on [stepik.org](https://stepik.org/course/63054/syllabus)    



Hope this repo will help you to assess my SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
